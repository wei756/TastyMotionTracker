## License
**This hardware is licensed under the CERN-OHL-P v2 license**, which is a permissive,
non-viral and non-reciprocal open hardware license. Unlike software licenses like
MIT and Apache 2.0, it better handles the nuances of hardware and protects both
the licensor and licensee from patent lawsuits.

**Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted
for inclusion in this work by you, shall be licensed as above, without any
additional terms or conditions.**

### Conveying notice of License
Note that as part of the CERN-OHL-P v2 license, recipients of manufactured
hardware must also receive notice of the above license. One such
method of conveying the notice is to include a link to the original source repo,
or printing "Licensed under CERN-OHL-P v2" on the PCB silkscreen. For more info,
see [here](https://ohwr.org/project/cernohl/wikis/Documents/CERN-OHL-version-2).

This is conceptually similar to the MIT/Apache 2.0 Licenses, where the original
license must still be included as a notice even when the source is modified and
subsequently relicensed under different terms.
